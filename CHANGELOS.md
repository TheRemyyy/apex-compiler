# Changelog

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-29

### ✨ Added

- **File I/O Support**: Added native support for file system operations via the `File` static object.
  - `File.read(path)`: Reads entire file to String.
  - `File.write(path, content)`: Writes content to file.
  - `File.exists(path)`: Checks for file existence.
  - `File.delete(path)`: Deletes a file.
- **New Examples**: Added `18_file_io.apex` and `app_notes.apex` demonstrating file system interactions.
- **Test Infrastructure**: Added `test_examples.bat` for automated verification of all example programs.

### ♻️ Changed

- **Standard Library Ownership**: Relaxed borrow checker rules for standard library functions (`strlen`, `println`, etc.). These functions now borrow their arguments instead of consuming them, allowing variables to be reused after being printed or measured.
- **Compiler Intrinsics**: Optimized C binding generation for standard library calls in the LLVM backend.

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Borrow Checker**: Fixed a bug where standard library calls would incorrectly mark string variables as moved.

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-28

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Critical Runtime Crash**: Fixed a bug where classes starting with "List" (e.g., `ListNode`) were incorrectly compiled as generic lists, causing stack corruption and runtime crashes.
- **List.set()**: Implemented missing `set(index, value)` method for `List<T>` in codegen.
- **Match Statements**: Fixed invalid LLVM IR generation (orphan blocks) for `match` statements.
- **Clippy Warnings**: Resolved `collapsible_match` and other lints in `codegen.rs`.
