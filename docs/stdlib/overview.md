# Standard Library

The Apex Standard Library (`std`) provides core functionality for building applications. It is compiled into the binary by default.

## Modules

- [Math](math.md): Mathematical functions and constants.
- [String](string.md): String manipulation utilities.
- [IO](io.md): Input and Output operations.
- [Collections](collections.md): Data structures (List, Map, Set).

(Note: IO and Collections documentation will be added as the library expands)
